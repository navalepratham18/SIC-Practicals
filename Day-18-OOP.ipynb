    "## Types of Methods in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "There are distinct types of methods in Python classes, distinguished by how they access data (State).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Instance Method\n",
    "The most common type of method. It acts upon a specific object (instance) of the class.\n",
    "* **Behavior:** Can access and modify unique data of the specific object (`self.variable`).\n",
    "* **Parameter:** Must have `self` as the first parameter.\n",
    "* **Decorator:** None required (default behavior).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Class Method\n",
    "A method that is bound to the **Class**, not the object. It can modify the class state that applies across all instances.\n",
    "* **Behavior:** Can access class variables but **cannot** access specific instance variables (`self`).\n",
    "* **Parameter:** Must have `cls` as the first parameter (stands for Class).\n",
    "* **Decorator:** Requires `@classmethod`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Static Method\n",
    "A utility method that belongs to the class namespace but **does not** access or modify the class or instance state. It is just a regular function that happens to live inside a class.\n",
    "* **Behavior:** Cannot access `self` or `cls`. It is isolated.\n",
    "* **Parameter:** No special first parameter (`self`/`cls` are not passed).\n",
    "* **Decorator:** Requires `@staticmethod`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Special Methods (Magic/Dunder Methods)\n",
    "These methods start and end with double underscores (`__`). They are not called directly but are invoked automatically by Python operators or built-in functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`__init__(self)` (Constructor):**\n",
    "    * **Trigger:** Automatically called when a new object is created.\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** Used to initialize the object's attributes (variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`__str__(self)` (String Representation):**\n",
    "    * **Trigger:** Automatically called when you use `print(object)` or `str(object)`.\n",
    "    * **Purpose:** Returns a human-readable string description of the object. If missing, Python prints the confusing memory address (e.g., `<__main__.Obj object at 0x00...>`).\n",
