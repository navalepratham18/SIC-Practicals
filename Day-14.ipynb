    "# Programming Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is Programming?\n",
    "Programming is the process of **designing, writing, testing, and maintaining** source code that a computer executes to perform a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. What is Sequential Programming?\n",
    "This is the **simplest form of program execution**. It is characterized by the following:\n",
    "* Statements are executed one after another.\n",
    "* The flow of execution moves strictly from **top to bottom**.\n",
    "* There is no skipping of instructions.\n",
    "* Most programming languages follow this model by default until control structures are introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "* **Easy to Understand:** The linear flow makes logic easy to trace.\n",
    "* **No Decision Making:** It lacks branching (e.g., `if-else` statements).\n",
    "* **No Repetition:** It lacks looping mechanisms (e.g., `for` or `while` loops).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. What is a Comment? & Types of Comments\n",
    "Comments are **non-executable lines of code**. They are ignored by the interpreter during execution and are used to explain logic, improve readability, or temporarily disable code for testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Comments (Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Single-Line Comment:**\n",
    "    * Created using the hash symbol (`#`).\n",
    "    * Everything following the `#` on that line is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multi-Line Comment:**\n",
    "    * Python uses **triple quotes** (`'''` or `\"\"\"`) for comments that span multiple lines.\n",
    "    * *Note: Technically, these are multi-line string literals, but they act as comments when not assigned to a variable.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Importance of Planning\n",
    "Planning is crucial before writing any code to ensure efficiency and accuracy.\n",
    "1. **Understand the Problem:** Clearly define what needs to be solved.\n",
    "2. **Decide Steps to Solve It:** Create a roadmap (Algorithm) before coding.\n",
    "3. **Avoid Logical Errors:** Thinking ahead prevents bugs that are hard to trace later.\n",
    "4. **Save Time and Effort:** Reduces the need for major rewrites during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Problem-Solving in Programming\n",
    "A systematic approach to developing software:\n",
    "1. **Understand the Problem:** Read requirements carefully.\n",
    "2. **Identify Inputs/Outputs:** Determine what data goes in and what result is expected.\n",
    "3. **Design Logic:** Plan the solution using pseudocode or flowcharts.\n",
    "4. **Write Code:** Translate the logic into syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Datatypes\n",
    "Datatypes define the category of data that a variable can store.\n",
    "* **Dynamic Typing:** Python automatically assigns the datatype based on the value assigned to the variable (no need to declare types explicitly).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Data Types\n",
    "1. **Integer (`int`):**\n",
    "   Whole numbers without a decimal point (e.g., `10`, `-5`, `0`).\n",
    "2. **Float (`float`):**\n",
    "   Numbers containing a decimal point (e.g., `10.5`, `3.14`, `-0.01`).\n",
    "3. **String (`str`):**\n",
    "   A sequence of characters enclosed in quotes (e.g., `\"Hello\"`, `'Python'`).\n",
    "4. **Boolean (`bool`):**\n",
    "   Represents truth values. Can only be `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Variables\n",
    "A variable is a named container used to store data values. In Python, variables are created the moment you assign a value to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Naming Rules:\n",
    "1.  **Start Character:** Must start with a letter (A-Z, a-z) or an underscore (`_`).\n",
    "2.  **Allowed Characters:** Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (Alphanumeric + `_`).\n",
    "3.  **No Numbers at Start:** A variable name **cannot** start with a number (e.g., `1var` is invalid).\n",
    "4.  **No Special Symbols:** Cannot use symbols like `@`, `$`, `%`, `-`, etc.\n",
    "5.  **Case Sensitive:** `age`, `Age`, and `AGE` are three different variables.\n",
    "6.  **No Keywords:** You cannot use reserved words (e.g., `if`, `while`, `class`) as variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Type Casting\n",
    "Type Casting is the process of converting one data type into another.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Implicit Casting:** Python automatically converts types (e.g., adding an integer to a float results in a float).\n",
    "* **Explicit Casting:** The programmer manually converts the type using functions:\n",
    "    * `int()` - Converts to Integer\n",
    "    * `float()` - Converts to Float\n",
    "    * `str()` - Converts to String\n",
    "\n"

    "### > **Important Note:** Python is a **Dynamically Typed Language**. This means the interpreter automatically identifies the datatype of a variable at runtime based on the value assigned. You do not need to declare types explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Built-in Data Structures (Collection Types)\n",
    "Python provides several built-in types to store collections of data:\n",
    "1.  **List**\n",
    "2.  **Tuple**\n",
    "3.  **Set**\n",

    "## 10. What is a List?\n",
    "A List is a collection used to store multiple items in a single variable. It is one of the most versatile data types in Python.\n",
    "* **Syntax:** Defined using square brackets `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "* **Mutable:** Elements can be changed, added, or removed after the list is created.\n",
    "* **Ordered (Indexed):** Items have a defined order, and you can access them using an index (starting from `0`).\n",
    "* **Duplicates Allowed:** You can store the same value multiple times.\n",
    "* **Heterogeneous:** Can store different datatypes (e.g., an integer, a string, and a float) in the same list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use a List?\n",
    "* **Efficiency:** Stores multiple related values in a single variable, keeping code organized.\n",
    "* **Flexibility:** Allows for easy manipulation of data (sorting, filtering, modifying).\n",
    "* **Iteration:** Makes it easy to loop through a sequence of data.\n",

    "| **Syntax** | `list.append(value)` | `list.insert(index, value)` |\n",
    "| **Performance** | Faster (O(1)) as no shifting is needed. | Slower (O(n)) because existing elements must shift to make space. |\n",

    "| Feature | `pop()` | `remove()` |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",

    "| **Return Value** | Returns the deleted element. | Returns `None`. |\n",
    "| **Default** | If no index is specified, removes the **last** item. | Requires a value argument; throws error if not found. |"
