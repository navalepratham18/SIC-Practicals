    "\n",

    "## Core Characteristics\n",

    "### 1. Locally Optimal Choice\n",
    "At every step, the algorithm picks the best available option **at that specific moment**, without worrying about the future consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Irrevocable\n",
    "Once a decision is made (e.g., \"I will take this path\"), it is **never changed**. The algorithm does not go back and change its mind (unlike Backtracking).\n",

    "**Restore the State.**\n",
    "* **Crucial Step:** After the recursive call returns (whether it found a solution or hit a dead end), you must **reverse** the change you made in step 2.\n",
    "* **Why?** So that the `State` is clean for the next iteration of the loop (the next choice).\n",

    "2.  **Move:** Go down a branch (Make a choice).\n",
